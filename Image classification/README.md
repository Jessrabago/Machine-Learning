# Image Classification
*Use of Neural networks*

- Results: Results: On each page it is possible to observe how the models behave with different configurations.
- CIFAR-10 database (Online)
## Summary :camera:
The CIFAR-10 database consists of 10 classes and a total of 60,000 images. This exercise seeks to find the most optimal solution by using neural networks, through comparison and tools such as hyperparameters, augmentation and regularization to make the accuracy as good as possible. Because I would like to have a classification that can match the name of the category with the image as accurately as possible.
## Conclusion :green_book:
The obtained results through the search for hyperparameters that could process the number of desired images with the ability to classify them, were a challenge, which in the end had a favorable result, since it was possible to finalize a program that could execute an Accuracy of more than of 80%.
