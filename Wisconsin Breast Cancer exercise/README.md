## Summary :paperclip:
This type of analysis to predict information is very helpful, since it is possible to give a pre-diagnosis. However, to get to the point I mentioned before, it is necessary to know well the dataset, the variables, the data types to be used, to continue with a pre-processing of the information. A good pre-process will make the values entered in the model to be developed optimal. After using models such as tree model, Lm, or cross validation, they will help to have a better approach, reflected in the results.
## Conclusion :flags:
Analyzing data is a process that requires a lot of patience, because mishandling functions will cause the model to fail or give false results. For the analysis of this dataset, using treemodel, made it possible to observe more how the variables work as 'hidden layers', in addition to using linear regression as the main function and seeing the variations that existed when using it either as PCA or with cross validation. However, a model with 82%, and a p-value less than 0.05 was achieved, performing as a good model.
