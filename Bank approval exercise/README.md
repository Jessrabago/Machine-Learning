## Documents :pushpin:
- Dataset 'as1-bank'
- Code
- Results: different graphs where the trial and error is shown, when modifying the models.
## Summary :books:
The analysis of the presented data, the model will be for 12 Inputs, 1 Output and once those are ready to be processed, a split of 75% and 25%, for Training Data and Test Data, respectively, will be perform.
## Conclusion :dart:
Making models and being able to compare them, adding the possibility to play with layers and neurons, or changing the percentage from 30% to 25%, seeing the variations in the graphs, made me understand that each model has its way of behaving, as well as in some it was necessary to add more layers or more neurons (L1 or L2), moreover, in others the simpler it was built the better results it produced. In the future, I think I'll find a better solution to this problem with maybe new features and a more efficient way of approaching it, because in this exercise you have as a limitation when modifying Neuros and layers.
